## Troubleshooting

To prevent d-bus warnings when running in WSL due to [#2941](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/2941), run

```bash
# If it's the first time running, run sudo
sudo scripts/run-dbus.sh  
# Otherwise, just source it
source scripts/run-dbus.sh
```

This won't prevent GPU errors such `dri3 extension not supported`. Also, won't suppress warning when running `test:hidden` and `test:insiders:hidden`
